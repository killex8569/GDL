RAID 0
Disk min: 2
Disk recommended: 2
Disk max: None / Infinite
Advantages:
- Maximum read/write performance thanks to striping
- Total capacity equals the sum of all disks (no storage overhead)
- Easy to implement
Disadvantages:
- No redundancy: the failure of a single disk results in total data loss
- Reduced reliability (failure risk increases with the number of disks)
- Not suitable for critical environments

RAID 1
Disk min: 2
Disk recommended: 2
Disk max: None / Infinite
Advantages:
- High fault tolerance: data remains available as long as one disk is healthy
- Simple to set up and recover
- Faster reads (parallel access from mirrored copies)
Disadvantages:
- 50% efficiency (only half of total storage capacity is usable)
- Higher storage cost
- Slightly slower writes (data written to both disks)

RAID 5
Disk min: 3
Disk recommended: 3
Disk max: None / Infinite
Advantages:
- Good balance between performance, capacity, and redundancy
- Can tolerate the failure of one disk
- High usable capacity (N-1 disks available for data)
- Fast reads due to striping
Disadvantages:
- Reduced write performance (parity calculation and storage required)
- Long and risky rebuild process (if a second disk fails during rebuild, all data is lost)
- Vulnerable to unrecoverable read errors (URE) on large disks

RAID 6
Disk min: 4
Disk recommended: 4
Disk max: None / Infinite
Advantages:
- Can tolerate the failure of two disks simultaneously
- Good read performance (similar to RAID 5)
- Suitable for large-capacity environments with big disks
Disadvantages:
- Slower write performance than RAID 5 (double parity calculation)
- Lower storage efficiency (N-2 disks usable for data)
- Even longer and more resource-intensive rebuilds
